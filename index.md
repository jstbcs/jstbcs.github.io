## <a name="about"></a> Welcome

I am a professor of psychological methods at the University of Potsdam. My research focuses on Bayesian hierarchical modeling of cognitive phenomena such as interference effects ([Does everyone Stroop?](pics/everyonestroops.png)), [recognition memory](https://psyarxiv.com/2dyn7/), and [subliminal priming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/methexp/subliminal-EC/master/main.pdf). With these hierarchical models, I aim to better understand individual differences cognitive tasks. Specifically, how much do individuals differ, and how can we disentangle stable, qualitative individual differences and sample noise.

Even though a large part of my research is developing statistical models, I am an experimental psychologist at heart, and I get excited about innovative, bold experimental designs. But I also believe that statistics are important to express and test psychological theory. And that Bayesian statistics are better suited to do so than conventional $t$-tests or ANOVA. My work particularly focuses on the usefulness of *ordinal constraints* in modeling. It seems that [ordinal constraints](https://psyarxiv.com/a4xu9/) are particularly well suited to capture theoretical predictions in psychology. 

Throughout my research, I try to be transparent and provide [data](https://github.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data3), [code](https://github.com/PerceptionAndCognitionLab), and open access to [manuscripts](https://psyarxiv.com/discover?q=haaf) I wrote. Click [here](#publications) for a list of publications.

And this is Frank, my cat.
